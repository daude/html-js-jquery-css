<p Id="change">Kathmandu(/ˌkɑːtmɑːnˈduː/;[4] Nepali pronunciation: [kɑʈʰmɑɳɖu]) is the capital and largest municipality of Nepal. It also hosts the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It is the only city of Nepal with the administrative status of Mahanagar (Metropolitan City), as compared to Upa-Mahanagar (Sub-Metropolitan City) or Nagar (City). Kathmandu is the core of Nepal's largest urban agglomeration, consisting of Lalitpur, Kirtipur, Madhyapur Thimi, Bhaktapur and a number of smaller communities in the Kathmandu Valley. Kathmandu is also known informally as KTM or the tri-city. According to the 2011 census, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has a population of 1,003,285 and measures 49.45 km2 (19.09 sq mi).[5]

The city stands at an elevation of approximately 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley of central Nepal.[6] It is surrounded by four major hills: Shivapuri, Phulchoki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri. <br>Kathmandu Valley is part of three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur), has the highest population density in the country, and is home to about a twelfth of Nepal's population.

Historically, the Kathmandu Valley and adjoining areas were known as Nepal Mandala.<br> Until the 15th century, Bhaktapur was its capital when two other capitals, Kathmandu and Lalitpur, were established.[7] During the Rana and Shah eras, British historians called the valley itself "Nepal Proper". Today, Kathmandu is not only the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, but also the headquarters of the Bagmati Zone.[8]</p>
